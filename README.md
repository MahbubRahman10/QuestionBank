# QuestionBank: Exam Practice Platform

## Introduction
This project aims to address the increasing dependence of students on the internet for educational resources, particularly in Bangladesh where digitalization is rapidly progressing. The Online Exam Practice Platform is a web application designed to assist BCS and other board exam candidates, including secondary school students, in their exam preparation.

## Purpose
In today's digital age, the internet has become a ubiquitous tool for accessing educational materials. However, there is a need for a platform tailored specifically to the needs of exam candidates, providing them with MCQ (Multiple Choice Question) and Creative Question preparation assistance, along with important advice, guidelines, and instructions from registered teachers. This project seeks to fill this gap by offering a comprehensive online resource for exam preparation.

## Scope
The Online Exam Practice Platform is intended to cater to various public examinations of Bangladesh such as JSC, SSC, HSC, BCS, and admission tests. Registered users will have access to features including MCQ practice, profile creation and updates, exam category selection, model tests and contests, forum support, access to informative content such as blogs, notices, and motivational speeches. Guest users will be able to view and download question sets and participate in discussion forums. Administrators will have the authority to manage user details, insert questions with topics, set exam durations, and handle user bans. Super administrators will oversee the maintenance of the entire software system.
